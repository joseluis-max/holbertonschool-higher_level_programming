- **What a URL is**

    Uniform Resource Locator is a uniquely identify a resource over the web

``` text
    protocol://hostname:port/path-and-file-name
```

- **What HTTP is**

    is an *asymmetric request-response client-server* protocol, stateless, permit negotiating of data type and representation.

- **How to read a URL**

    ``` text
    protocol://hostname:port/path-and-file-name
    ```

    There are 4 parts in a URL:

    1. *Protocol*: The application-level protocol used by the client and server, e.g., HTTP, FTP, and telnet.
    2. *Hostname*: The DNS domain name (e.g., `www.nowhere123.com`) or IP address (e.g., 192.128.1.2) of the server.
    3. *Port*: The TCP port number that the server is listening for incoming requests from the clients.
    4. *Path-and-file-name*: The name and location of the requested resource, under the server document base directory.
- **The scheme for a HTTP URL**

    the browser translates the URL into a request message according to the specified protocol, in this case HTTP.

    ``` text
    GET /docs/index.html HTTP/1.1
    Host:www.nowhere123.com
    Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
    Accept-Language: en-us
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
    (blank line)
    ```

    When this request reaches the server:

    1. Server maps the request into a file in server directory and response this file.
    2. Server maps the request into a process in the server. execute the process and response the output of the process to the client.
    3. The request can’t be satisfied. response with a status error.

    ``` text
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Sun, 18 Oct 2009 08:56:53 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
    Last-Modified: Sat, 20 Nov 2004 07:16:26 GMT
    ETag: "10000000565a5-2c-3e94b66c2e680"
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    Content-Length: 44
    Connection: close
    Content-Type: text/html
    X-Pad: avoid browser bug

    <html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
    ```

- **What a domain name is**

    Is a identifier which maps with a IP address.

- **What a sub-domain is**

    A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain.

- **How to define a port number in a URL**

    ``` text
    protocol://hostname:port/path-and-file-name
    ```

- **What a query string is**

    Is a string "`name=value`" pairs, and concatenates all the fields together using "`&`" as the field separator.

    Used for send information in the request to the server by get or post methods.

    ```text
    name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3&...
    ```

- **What an HTTP request is**

    Is a message to server from in the client.

- **What an HTTP response is**

    Is a message to client from in the server.

- **What HTTP headers are**

    Is metadata about the request or the respond in the format key:value pairs, separated by commas:

    ```txt
    Host: www.xyz.com
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
    Accept-Language: us-en, fr, cn
    ```

- **What the HTTP message body is**

    The response message body contains the resource data requested.

- **What an HTTP request method is**

    Is a action that we can execute in the server, are listed some below:

    `GET`: A client can use the GET request to get a web resource from the server.

    `HEAD`: A client can use the HEAD request to get the header that a GET request would have obtained. Since the header contains the last-modified date of the data, this can be used to check against the local cache copy.

    `POST` Used to post data up to the web server.

    `PUT`: Ask the server to store the data.

    `DELETE`: Ask the server to delete the data.

    `TRACE`: Ask the server to return a diagnostic trace of the actions it takes.

    `OPTIONS`: Ask the server to return the list of request methods it supports.

    `CONNECT`: Used to tell a proxy to make a connection to another host and simply reply the content, without attempting to parse or cache it. This is often used to make SSL connection through the proxy.

- **What an HTTP response status code is**

    Is information about the outcome of the request generated by the server.

- **What an HTTP Cookie is**

    is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.

    Used for:

    Session management

    Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember

    Personalization

    User preferences, themes, and other settings

    Tracking

    Recording and analyzing user behavior

- **How to make a request with cURL**

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000/sample?name=aditya
    ```

- **What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level)**
    1. The browser search in the cache if have the IP address for google.com
    2. If no is founded the browser sent a request for DNS for to get the IP Address.
    3. Then when have it, send a HTTP request to the IP and wait for the responde of the server.
